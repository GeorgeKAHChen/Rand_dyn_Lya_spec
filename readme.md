# Lyapunov Spectrum Calculator

This is a Lyapunov Spectrum Calculator.

Lyapunov exponent is a wildly used numerical method to consider a dynamical system is chaos or not. The Lyapunov spectrum is the high dimension version of this Lyapunov exponent. Also, it is simple to consider the Lyapunov dimension if we found the Lyapunov spectrum, which has been used in numerical estimate of Hausdorff dimension, a important fractal dimension for chaos analysis.
